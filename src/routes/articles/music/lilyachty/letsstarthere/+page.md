<ArticleTitle title="Lil Yachty - Let's Start Here. (2023)" {image}>

#### written 4/23/2025

I hadn't heard much of Lil Yachty when I began to listen to this album back in the summer of 2023. I knew he was a pretty well-known rapper and almost nothing else. I wasn't tapped into music at all at this time, and had gotten the reccomendation for this album off r/glassanimals. I listened to a few of the tracks and enjoyed it and that's all I can remember. One day though, I came back to the album and fell in love with it. I don't know why but it really clicked for me one day.

*Let's Start Here* is an album that is not typical for a rapper like Yachty. I don't know why he decided to do a pysch rock album all of a sudden, or who gave him LSD, but THANK GOD he did. This album is a masterpiece, from the banging guitar to the drowned out vocals to the blissful features scattered throughout.

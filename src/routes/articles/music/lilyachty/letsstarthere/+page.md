<ArticleTitle title="Lil Yachty - Let's Start Here. (2023)" {image}>

#### written 6/11/2025

I hadn't heard much of Lil Yachty when I began to listen to this album back in the summer of 2023. I knew he was a pretty well-known rapper and almost nothing else. I wasn't tapped into music at all at this time, and had gotten the reccomendation for this album off r/glassanimals. I listened to a few of the tracks and enjoyed it and that's all I can remember. One day though, I came back to the album and fell in love with it. I don't know why but it really clicked for me one day.

*Let's Start Here* is an album that is not typical for a rapper like Yachty. I don't know why he decided to do a pysch rock album all of a sudden, or who gave him LSD, but THANK GOD he did. This album is a masterpiece, from the banging guitar to the drowned out vocals to the blissful features scattered throughout.

The album starts out with the track *the BLACK seminole.*, which beautifully sets the tone of the album. The calm drums, Yachty's drugged out vocals, the guitar. It's a very nice, groovy track before it transforms into a guitar solo and loses the vocals for the rest of the song (except for some beautiful singing from Diana Gordon).

The following tracks until *:(failure(:* are pretty groovy and fun tracks, with *the ride-* featuring Teezo Tocuhdown, *running out of time* getting Magdalena Bay on production, and Foushe√© giving a verse on the sex-fueled track *pRETTy*.

*:(failure(:* is a fantastic interlude, where Yachty actually says some pretty insightful stuff on failure, wealth, and success. This interlude is followed by *THE zone~*, which opens up with a booming guitar and some slow drums, where Yachty proceeds to talk about his struggles of belonging and what home is to him. Yachty illustrates a trip in the next track, before transitioning to the hit *drive ME crazy!* through a clip of Bob Ross speaking about his artistic process.

*drive ME crazy!* is a super catchy love song, vocalized between Yachty and Diana Gordon, done to drums by Mac DeMarco. Yachty finishes the track with a rap verse, before transitioning to my favorite track, *IVE OFFICIALLY LOST ViSiON!!!!!*. You don't hear much in the beginning other than a lot of distortion, before Yachty starts screaming and yells "FUCK!" and sings about how he did too many drugs with drained out vocals. Diana Gordon comes on to emphasize that she'll always love Yachty, no matter how wrong he can be.

Yachty gives us four more fantastic psychadelic rock songs before finally transitioning to the end of the album, *REACH THE SUNSHINE.*, where he enlists Daniel Caesar to create a chilling, introspective track that finishes with beautiful, banging drums over guitar as Yachty reaches the peak of his high. Then, as the intense drums fade out, we are transported into a calm, where Yachty concludes the album through revisiting the synths and beeps that we heard in the very beginning.

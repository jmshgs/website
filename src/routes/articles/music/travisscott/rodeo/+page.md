<ArticleTitle title="Travis Scott - Rodeo (2015)" {image}>

#### written 4/13/2025

*Rodeo* by Travis Scott is my favorite album ever. I discovered it a few years back and have played it over 1400 times ever since.

I don't entirely remember how I discovered this album, but I recall wanting more of Travis from what I had heard at the time. I first got into Travis when I listened to a lot of *Utopia* when it released in the Summer of 2023. I remember bumping it on the plane and hearing Kid Cudi on *LOOOVE* and the whole experience being amazing. I wanted more of Travis when I returned home, and listened to Astroworld a lot. I couldn't really see much substance in Astroworld at the time though, and I wanted something different, so I went back in his discography to listen to his debut album: *Rodeo*.

The album opens with *Pornography*, an electric song filled with booming synths introducing Travis and his ambitious life through narration from T.I. (which is similar to Common on *Man on the Moon: The End of Day* by Cudi (who Travis is massively influenced by)). The next track, *Oh My Dis Side*, continues Travis's narrative of growing up in Houston and moving into LA in the future and sleeping on a couch. The second part of this track, *Dis Side*, is extremely nostalgic and takes us back to his early life in Houston. This song also introduces the first real feature with Quavo, who provides some of his beautiful ad-libs in the first half and then delivers a verse in the second. This and the next track are considered some of the highlights of the album, even though every track basically is. Metro Boomin comes in on *3500* to deliver an absolutely insane beat where Future provides a brilliant chorus and 2 Chainz comes in with a fantastic verse as well.

The features on *Rodeo* are consistently brilliant, with Travis bringing in Toro y Moi for a song (unexpected but we saw him on Travis's first offical mixtape, *Owl Pharoah*). The real suprise is Justin Bieber on *Maria I'm Drunk* (my personal favorite), where he delivers an incredible verse alongside Young Thug and Travis. Travis also enlists singer Kacy Hill on the 3x platinum track *90210*, who delivers an angelic feature about a prostitute in LA of all things.

Throughout the album, Travis showcases his masterful writing; a prime of exmaple of which is when he describes his dick as being "longer than a Pringle box" on the track *Pray 4 Love* with The Weeknd. He also delivers memorable verses and hooks throughout the album, and more introspective and emotional cuts with songs like *Impossible* and *Apple Pie*, while also creating bangers for the club with *Nightcrawler* and *Antidote*. Through all this, Travis brings home an incredible debut studio album, with some of the best cuts in trap ever.

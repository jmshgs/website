<ArticleTitle title="ICE in LA" {image}>

#### written 6/10/25

I've been using Twitter (sorry for the deadname) pretty chronically since Trump ordered the National Guard into California without a good reason. What's going on in LA at the moment is crazy and there's been so much media covering the situation. Let me just give a brief overview though in case you are 1) living under a rock or 2) the average American.

ICE is targeting California heavily because it's a pretty educated, diverse, and democratic state, which Trump hates. Unfortunately for Trump, people don't really like getting deported and there have been large protests brewing in rebellion of ICE in Southern California. Trump warned in his campaign that he would utilize the military in order to shut down protests without talking to the state governors, which he wasn't able to do during his first term as the people around him weren't as extreme. Trump now has the power to follow through on this and he has. As the protests escalated over the past few days, flash bangs and rubber bullets began to appear in the protests. Eventually, Trump decided to send in 2,000 members of the California National Guard in order to enforce his autocratic regime.

*KIDS SEE GHOSTS* is an interesting album. Created by Kanye West and Kid Cudi in 2018, it is the 3rd record that Kanye produced during his notable "Wyoming Sessions". It was released just a week after *ye* was released (they were eating good back in 2018).

The album takes some time to get used to because everything about it is so different. The production is insanely innovative, and not in a *2093* way where the album is stacked with synths and whatnot, but instead because of the uniqueness and minimalistic production used throughout the album. 

The album opens up with *Feel The Love*, a track with just one real verse--which was recorded about 6 hours before the album was released--from Pusha T over no drums, and then the rest of the track being Kanye making gunshot sounds. 10/10 opener. *KIDS SEE GHOSTS* is an album that speaks a lot about mental health and beliefs, and while we don't see this too obviously in the first track, Kid Cudi is there providing the opening message: that he can still feel the love around him, even with his many troubles over the years.

The next few tracks have rock-inspired sounding beats, with claps and chants scattered throughout beats with a ton of different guitars and drums. Kanye and Cudi address their haters and past mistakes in the song *Fire*, while in *4th Dimension* they brag a bit whilst Cudi speaks about his dark past. Kanye continues his song released a week before, *Ghost Town*, in *Freeee* and stays consistent with the message demonstrated in *Fire*: Kanye and Cudi are free and have let go of caring for opinions revolving around them. Cudi says he "died and came back twice", referring to his drug problems and going to rehab, which he touches on more in *Reborn*.

*Reborn* is one of the more emotional tracks on the album, where Cudi opens up on how he has been reborn after his drug problems and is moving forwards in life, and then Kanye gives a heartfelt verse on how he's been rediculed and called insane over the years. Cudi returns with a verse on his own troubles, speaking about a loss of purpose and trouble finding peace in his life and not knowing where to start when solving his issues. Finally though, he prevails in the chorus, where he is reborn and not stressed about life.

Kanye has a great verse on the title track, which is surrounded by a mellow chorus by Yasiin Bey, before the album closes with the track that hits home for me the most: *Cudi Montage*. A grimy guitar sample from Kurt Cobain provides the background for Cudi to open up about his pain before he asks for God to shine his love on him, and save Cudi from the pain. Kanye's verse touches on violence and crime, and the massive impact it has on the people that it affects. Kanye grew up in Chicago, where he says crime is the requirement, and then once their job is done they are sent off to prison for the rest of their lives; essentially retirement. The rest of the song is Kanye and Cudi coming together to ask God for help in this world, and you can hear the pain in Kanye's voice as it breaks down a little throughout this chrous. This is where I've cried before.
 
In a mix of these emotional cuts and production choices that have never been seen before, Kanye and Cudi rekindle after their past troubles to create a near-perfect album on their struggles.

*Rodeo* by Travis Scott is my favorite album ever. I discovered it a few years back and have played it over 1400 times ever since.

I don't entirely remember how I discovered this album, but I recall wanting more of Travis from what I had heard at the time. I first got into Travis when I listened to a lot of *Utopia* when it released in the Summer of 2023. I remember bumping it on the plane and hearing Kid Cudi on *LOOOVE* and the whole experience being amazing. I wanted more of Travis when I returned home, and listened to Astroworld a lot. I couldn't really see much substance in Astroworld at the time though, and I wanted something different so I went back in his discography to listen to his debut album: *Rodeo*.

*Pornography*, the opening track is jarring and electric. I didn't like this track when I first listened to the album. It somehow seemed boring to me and bland, and it was the only track on the album I didn't have favorited for a while. One day it just clicked though. <br> T.I. opens the song with narration, similar to Common on *Man on the Moon: The End of Day* by Cudi (who Travis is massively influenced by). T.I. details the environment and  mentality of Travis, who he refers to by his real name: Jacques. He explains that Jacques is a rebel, and jumped off the porch to get out of wherever he was. He doesn't know where he'll end up, but wherever it is, "it's better than here". Once T.I.'s narration ends, Travis comes in with a trippy, dreamy, deep voice and details what he fantasizes. Money, sex, drugs. Fame and glory. He paints of a picture of his relationships, revolving around drugs and the club. 

Travis pictures LA as this place, but is snapped back to reality by T.I again, speaking about how Travis must lead the misfits and rebels, and the world belonging to Travis. The song transitions into a fast beat, where Travis raps about waking up and getting his shit together. He speaks about his ambition, how outlandish he is, how he is going to rise to the top of the podium. Travis ends the song saying "we gon' rule the world" (pretty much true nowadays) and T.I. gives a little quoute from Travis at the end: "let your ambition carry you".

The second track, *Oh My Dis Side* is a masterpiece. I mean everything is on this album but this track especially. It
